# System Health Check — 2025-01-26

## Overview
- **Scope**: Evaluated SPA architecture (Tailwind-driven UI, modular `init(target)` entry points, tenant-aware state) and supporting assets. 
- **Internationalization**: Confirmed primary locale bundles are present for de-AT, tr-TR, and en-GB variants; UTF-8 keys render correctly. 
- **Version Alignment**: Module manifests remain aligned with package version `1.3.1097`, indicating consistent tenant module versioning. 

## Build Verification
- `npm run build` → **PASS**. Vite + Tailwind pipeline completed, generated hashed assets (including locale bundles) and executed post-build CSS normalization. 

## Test Verification
- `npm test` → **FAIL**.
  - Identity smoke specs executed via `tsx` runner and passed (role guard, permission templates). 
  - Vitest suite failed on four identity test files:
    - `identity/tests/auth.flow.test.js`: missing runtime dependency `../src/db.js` under Vite transform. 
    - `identity/tests/permissionTemplates.spec.ts`, `roleGuard.spec.ts`, `tasks.notifications.test.ts`: flagged as “No test suite found” when re-run under Vitest (already executed earlier via `tsx`). 
  - Recommendation: Exclude identity integration specs from Vitest or provide compatible wrappers so CI does not double-run them.

## Dependency & Security Review
- `npm audit --json` highlights **5 moderate** vulnerabilities across 698 dependencies. No high/critical issues detected. 
  - Next step: evaluate `npm audit fix` (non-force) to confirm whether moderated patches exist without breaking SPA build.

## Additional Observations
- Tailwind utility usage plus dark-mode toggles remain active and bound to AppState theme strategy, preserving responsive and accessibility goals. 
- Tenant isolation relies on `AppState.tenant` propagation; ensure downstream API clients continue enforcing `x-tenant-id` scope guards during backend checks.

## QA Summary
| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | ✅ | Assets generated, strip-webkit post-process completed. |
| `npm test` | ❌ | Vitest re-running identity specs without suites; requires config adjustment. |
| `npm audit` | ⚠️ | 5 moderate vulnerabilities pending triage. |
