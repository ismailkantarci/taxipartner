# Header Module Rules

- Header must be fixed (`position: fixed`, `h-14`, `z-[999]`).
- Header always stays above all layers (sidebar, content).
- Header contains toggle button with id `#toggleSidebar`.
- Tenant and language selectors are embedded in header.
- Profile menu must support click-to-open and outside click to close.
- Header must not overlap content; layout must start after header (`mt-14` or similar).
